# fast-stomp
input and output benchmark circuits of fast-stomp

Feynman (https://github.com/meamy/feynman) has verified part of the circuits. 

The file fastbm.log contains final t-count and other statistics.

This folder contains 3 kinds of files:

the one with extension .log (except fastbm.log) is the proof outputed by "feynver".

the one with _i is the input circuit in .qc format.

the one with _o is the output circuit of stomp.

Also, the pair of _i and _o file is the input of feynver.

All the circuits except gf256.tfc are from: https://github.com/njross/optimizer/tree/master/QFT_and_Adders

gf256.tfc is downloaded from: http://webhome.cs.uvic.ca/~dmaslov/

Thank Matt for timely adding new functionality in Feynman.
